If this isn't your dog, please help share this information so that we can reunite her with her family. ******************** /13 We have just given her a good bath with a herbal soap as her skin is quite bad. We really do hope that her family claims her soon. She is very depressed. /13 Found this girl stuck inside a 5 foot deep drain while walking the kids this morning. She was looking very weak and exhausted. So told her to stay there, raced the kids back and got Nicole Lee Suresh to come with me to get her out. We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results. Her fur is very dirty although not obvious in the pictures and she also has skin issues. But otherwise she seems reasonably well taken care of. ",
