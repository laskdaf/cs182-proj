When I first approached her she eyed me nervously but once I had spoken to her for a while and assured her I meant no harm and only wanted to help she came up to me and gave me the best kisses and cuddles! She had a hole under one armpit that was starting to fester and was very skinny and full of fleas. The fact that she did not run away and was so quick to trust means that she was probably not a wild dog from the area but rather an abandoned pet :( This lovely little lady now stays with me and 12 other dogs. She is well socialized, I have two cats as well and she is very confident around people. She is now at full health, full of energy and has so much love to give! ",
